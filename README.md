**Title of Research**: "Vivir cuidando: Usando m√©todos mixtos para comprender las redes de cuidados y soporte de personas mayores" ("Living taking care: using mixed methods to understand care and social support networks of older people"). 

**Institutional affiliation**: Millennium Institute for Caregiving Research MICARE.
**Years of research**: November 2021 - Octuber 2023. 

**Ethics**: Approved by Ethical Comitte P. Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile (May 2022). 
**Fieldwork team**: Trinidad Cereceda, Natacha Leroy, and Ignacia Luco. 

**Main objetive**: Understand care and social support networks of the older people in Santiago de Chile. More specifically, identifying and describing the care and support networks for them, with an emphasis on gender and age diferences.

**Specific objetives**: 
- Identify and describe care and support networks for the older people, with an emphasis on gender and age inequalities.
- Build typologies of care and support networks for the older people, and how they vary over time will be explored.
- Evaluate the relevance of the time elapsed in the maintenance of care and support networks for the older people through network modeling.

**Abstract research**:
In recent years, Chile has become one of the countries with the highest replacement rate in Latin America, especially if we consider the southern cone (P√©rez and Sierra, 2009; ECLAC, 2015). In this context, older people find themselves under a neoliberal pension regime, which has been shown to increase long-term structural inequities (Wisensale, 2003, Sojo, 2014). In addition to this, there are previous studies that highlight that, to this day, family ties still persist at the state level as the caregivers and fundamental supports of the elderly (Ortiz and Gonz√°lvez, 2107). In this context, the supportive care that older people receive and deliver becomes increasingly relevant.
This research seeks to understand the care and support networks of the elderly in Santiago de Chile. More specifically, this study will focus on identifying and describing care and support networks for the elderly, with an emphasis on gender and age inequalities. Second, typologies of care and support networks for the elderly will be developed, and how they vary over time will be explored. Finally, the relevance of the time elapsed in the maintenance of care and support networks for the elderly will be evaluated. It is planned to carry out field work in Santiago de Chile, collecting a variety of data such as documents, surveys, interviews and a generator of names of care and support networks. The methodological approach is based on mixed methods with a complementarity of different data collected and analyzed.

# Current state of the research (last update 05.07.2022):
